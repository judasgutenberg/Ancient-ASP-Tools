# Ancient-ASP-Tools
I got my first dotcom job in San Diego in October 1998, and 
soon realized that the ASP embedded in web pages was similar to the BASIC I'd learned as a teenager playing with a VIC-20 or Commodore 128.  There was even a way to access the file system, which made it possible to persist data and automate a lot of dreary tasks then being done manually.  These are some of the web-based automation tools I built.  The company I built these for has long since ceased to exist and I doubt anyone who inherited this intellectual property (probably Mitt Romney) is aware that it belongs to them.  Until I get a cease & desist letter on fancy letterhead, it's yours to enjoy.
