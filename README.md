# Ancient-ASP-Tools
I got my first real dotcom job in San Diego in October 1998, and 
soon realized that the ASP embedded in web pages was similar to the BASIC I'd learned as a teenager playing with a VIC-20 or Commodore 128.  There was even a way to access the file system, which made it possible to persist data and automate a lot of dreary tasks then being done manually.  These are some of the web-based automation tools I built.  The company I built these for has long since ceased to exist and I doubt anyone who inherited this intellectual property (probably Mitt Romney) is aware that it now belongs to them.  Until I get a cease & desist letter on fancy letterhead, it's yours to enjoy.

One of the more amusing things about this code was my penchant for naming variables in all lowercase with names that often vary slightly from what is actually being represented.  Instead of a variable called path, I might have one called pather. Instead of one called folder, I'd have one called foljer. Some of this might've been a reflex to avoid using reserved words. The use of all lowercase was probably a consequence of ASP Visual BASIC Script not distinguishing between different case permutations in paths or variable names.
